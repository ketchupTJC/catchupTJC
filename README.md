## Git

Install Git onto your machine. If you're not sure how, use this [link](https://www.linode.com/docs/development/version-control/how-to-install-git-on-linux-mac-and-windows/) and follow it step by step.

Once Git is installed onto your machine, manuever through your files in terminal with:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
cd *folder name*
```

and to go up one:

```bash
cd ../
```

In your preferred folder use the command in terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ketchupTJC/catchupTJC.git
```

## Installation

Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) with its package manager [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install).

Once the Node Package Manager(npm) is installed, run the following commands in terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

to install all relevant node modules.

## Run

To run the application use the following commands in terminal:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start-dev
```

These commands will build the project locally and host onto local machine on port 8080 which can be accessed by typing "http://localhost:8080/" into your browser address.

Any changes you make will reflect on the browser on save.

## Teamwork

If you would like to make a contribution to the project, please create a branch from master by using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ketchupTJC/catchupTJC.git
git checkout -b "name your branch here"
```

When you've finished making the changes you'd like to make, follow this [link](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) and make a pull request to be reviewed by the team.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
